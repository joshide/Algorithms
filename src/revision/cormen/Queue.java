		 * We remove from the head and delete from the tail
		 * head represent the head of the queue i.e element that will be removed if dequeued action is called
		 * tail represent the tail of the queue and represent the array index where next element will be inserted
		 * when head == tail we say that queue is empty
		 * And when head = tail + 1 we say queue is full
		 * We can also use above two conditions in queue wrapping in an array
